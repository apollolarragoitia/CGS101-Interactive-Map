        <h1>Journey to Sovereignty: Mapping Key Moments in Hawaiian Movement History</h1>
        This website contains a variety of markers across an interactive map of the Hawai`i island chain. Each marker on the map corresponds to a specific event or location important to Hawaiian Sovereignty. Clicking on a marker will provided a preamble that discusses the event that occured at that place and how it effected the Native fight for Sovereignty.
        
        
        <h2>An Illegal Occupation</h2>
            Following contact, indigenous populations severely declined due to disease, resulting in a severe drop in the population of natives as well as a decline in birth rates. Over time, the economically lucrative potential of the islands became apparent to businessmen of the West, prompting an illegal occupation in 1893 by the United States military in support of businessmen looking to set up sugar and pineapple plantations. The overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani marked the end of Hawaiian sovereignty.  By 1900, the Hawaii island chain had become a territory of the United States.<br />

            This occupation aimed to erase Hawaiian culture and enforce the hetero-patriarchy in the native Hawaiian population. The languages of the islands were banned, and the land of sacred meaning had been turned into plantations and capital for the West looking to exploit the land for its resources and wealth. <br />

            As the lucrative profits of plantations began to decline, those in power still did not release Hawaii.
            They began to exploit the people and their culture for wealth. A culture once forced to live in secrecy was now forced to perform for colonizing visitors in a form of cultural prostitution. For example, the dance of hula. These activities once banned are now performed by native Hawaiians under the duress of capitalist pressures. <br />

            As cultural prostitution has propagated, the enforcement of Western ideas has taken place since first contact. The hetero-patriarchy, a tool of control used to instill ideas of faux gender inferiority was introduced and propagated– a sudden shift to a society where women were not allowed to exist in an autonomous state of self-governance and power. The egalitarian society of pre-contact was conducive to a woman's independence. Women were seen as more than just objects of sex and reproduction as they are seen in the West. They held powerful positions in society, both as leaders and in religion. Women were not solely defined by their gender and were not bound to a singular role or job as a result of it.<br />
 
            Today, Hawaii continues to be occupied illegally by the United States – the island chain is primarily used as a base of operations by the United States military. It continues to serve and demonstrate power and violence over those who have called the island chain home for over 4,000 years. It is a reminder that the United States aims to maintain control through fear and violence; subduing the population of native Hawaiians through the brutal and slow erasure of their culture.
